# Goal

- I should be able fomulate constarints, such as:
    - Individual active hours.
- I should be able to argue for why Pm||C_max is NP-Hard thus using a hueristic
- I should be able to do a worst care analysis
- Each machine has different 'time' for same task.

It is the intent that each team is equally able to solve an issue within the same timeframe.
This is offen not the case it pratice, but a system that expects this, would enable the team to do so over time. 
This is because issues are devided by the system unabiguesly among the team, thus everyone gets to learn to solve the set of issues that the team shold be able to solve.
Therefor it is in the best intrest of SDU that the system works like this.
It is to be expected that the system will perform suboptimal in the start because of this.

- If the team is use to that certain people solve a certain task, and that changes, 
  that task could take longer to solve by another on the team. 
  This means the system in general may predict shorter solve time than the true solve time.
- Selecting the correct team should not be a problem.
- If a predicted team-responsible is wrong, then always ask why.
- If a predicted scheduled responsible is wrong, then always ask why.

- Reducing the amount of wrongly assigned requests.
